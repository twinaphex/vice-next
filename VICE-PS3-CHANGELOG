Vice 2.2.7
PS3 port by TimRex


ChangeLog
---------

Build 1.0.3 (18-12-2010):
-----------------------
   - Configuration / Settings can now be saved

   - Menu based configuration now suports some of the more common VICE settings
    
   - Added mouse support

   - Physical keyboard support improved (though still a few bugs). Added positional/symbolic key layout modes

   - Added ZIP and GZIP support

   - Added HUD options for framerate/speed display

   - Added HUD options for Disk/Tape activity

   - Added multiple disk drive support
     Disk images can be inserted using TRIANGLE + L1/L2/R1/R2 for drives 8, 9, 10, 11 respectively.

   - ReSID-FP support has been added, providing significantly better audio emulation.
     Turn up the speakers on this, it's a world of difference.

   - Support for various SID models have been added as part of ReSID-FP

   - Maximum resampling under ReSID-FP is now default, using the original 6581R4 model SID.
 
     Performance notes:

      - Before ReSID-FP optimisation
        
           Interpolation     100% CPU   (warp mode - 530%)  
           Resampling (20)   100% CPU   (warp mode - 341%)
           Resampling (50)   100% CPU   (warp mode - 312%)
           Resampling (70)   100% CPU   (warp mode - 258%)
           Resampling (90)   100% CPU   (warp mode - 195%)

      - After ReSID-FP optimisation (AltiVec)

           Interpolation     100% CPU   (warp mode - 521%)  
           Resampling (20)   100% CPU   (warp mode - 381%)
           Resampling (50)   100% CPU   (warp mode - 367%)
           Resampling (70)   100% CPU   (warp mode - 338%)
           Resampling (90)   100% CPU   (warp mode - 286%)


   - Undecided if display filters should be disabled upon frameskip detection.
     Even at the highest ReSID settings the Bloom filter still achieves 20 fps.  While not quite 50fps, it's
     not *entirely* noticeable.  If you experience slowdown using any filters, try reducing the resolution to 720p
     or use a lower quality SID setting.

   - Fixed a bug when using compatibility mode. Occasionally TDE was not enabled correctly.


Build 1.0.2 (08-12-2010):
-----------------------
   - ReSID emulation optimised to use AltiVec instruction set, yielding significant performance boost
     against higher quality audio emulation in resampling mode.  We now achieve 100% C64 CPU clock at 
     the highest quality.
      
        Resampling (20)   100% CPU   (warp mode - 313%)
        Resampling (50)   100% CPU   (warp mode - 296%)
        Resampling (70)   100% CPU   (warp mode - 286%)
        Resampling (90)   100% CPU   (warp mode - 216%)

     Even DualSid (SidStereo) mode at 90% Resampling yields 100% CPU  (warp mode - 114%).

   - Default ReSID quality now set to maximum  (Resampling at 90% Band Pass)

   - Resampling quality automatically decreases by 10% if any underrun occurs.
     This generally kicks in when the Bloom or CRT filters are active.

   - Fixed minor redraw bug that caused the screen buffer to flip back to settings screen after a blit timeout
   - Added PIC1.PNG

   - Support to insert a disk image without rebooting (TRIANGLE)

   - Added compatibility SlowLoad mode (SQUARE)	
     This will disable FastLoad and enable True Drive Emulation (TDE) for those titles that require it
     for improved compatibility

   - Mapped RUN/STOP key to L3

   - Mapped right control-stick to cursor keys (up/down/left/right)
   
   - Fixed F1/F3/F5/F7 key mapping

   - Finally... Disabling audio emulation altogether during warp mode has increased CPU throughput to 1749%
     That ought to help any long load times.

   - Optimised audio buffer sizes

   - Added C128 support (VDC 80 column display is emulated, but not viewable)


Build 1.0.1 (04-12-2010):
-----------------------

  - On-Screen Keyboard fixed.

  - Initial support for ReSID emulation.
      - Currently defaults to FastSID
        Edit the vicerc file to enable Interpolation or Resampling methods.

          SidResidSampling=0	// FastSID        (default)

          SidResidSampling=1	// Interpolation  (better quality, slower)

          SidResidSampling=1	// Resampling     (best quality, slowest)
          SidResidPassband=90   // Sets the frequency band percentage to apply resampling.

  Performance Notes:
    ReSID emulation is currently unoptimised for the CELL processor.
    As such, performance at the BASIC prompt (when no sound is playing) yields the following real C64 CPU speeds.

        FastSID           100% CPU   (warp mode - 1143%)

        Interpolation     100% CPU   (warp mode - 352%)

        Resampling (20)   100% CPU   (warp mode - 196%)
        Resampling (50)   100% CPU   (warp mode - 195%)
        Resampling (70)   100% CPU   (warp mode - 117%)
        Resampling (90)    33% CPU

Thanks go out to Squarepusher, Shinhalsafar, Cm0nkey, Airmaker for their hard work on the Snes9x PS3 port,
and their cellFramework library.  This work also incorporates their menu system and config UI.
Also to the original VICE team for creating a solid and well maintained codebase to work with.
