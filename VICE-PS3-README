         D-PAD         - Joystick

         SELECT        - Swap joysticks
         START         - Menu/Configuration

         TRIANGLE      - Mapped to keyboard for 'Y'
         CIRCLE        - Mapped to keyboard for 'N'  -  Doubly mapped to 'UP'  (See note 1)
         SQUARE        - Mapped to keyboard for <space>

         L1            - Mapped to keyboard for 'F1'
         L2            - Mapped to keyboard for 'F3'
         R1            - Mapped to keyboard for 'F5'
         R2            - Mapped to keyboard for 'F7'

         L3            - Run/Stop

         L-Stick       - Replicates D-pad controls


    *1  The CIRCLE button has been doubly mapped to the joystick 'UP' direction. This is useful for platform style
        games where the UP direction indicates a JUMP action.  Clearly a difference in design aesthetics between joysticks 
        and control pads, this might be more desirable.


Keyboard Controls:
---------------
	RUN/STOP	Esc
	CTRL		Tab


Performance Notes:
------------

Under normal conditions at 1080p, there are no performance issues whatsoever. In fact, under warp mode vice can
achieve 1800% normal CPU speed of an original Commodore 64 (when idle at the BASIC prompt).

Performance will decrease significantly when using the Bloom or CRT filters.
This can be marginally compensated for by reducing the audio quality 
(eg: Instead of ReSID-FP, try ReSID or FastSID emulation).

A far better solution is to lower the resolution to 1600x1080, or at worst 1280x1080. 
Even the hardest demo wont have any problem running at these resolutions.



Known Issues
------------

- bzip2 compressed formats are currently NOT supported
- Keyboard support may not be correct for non-english / non QWERTY keyboard layouts
- Keyboard support has some remaining bugs regarding shift-keys


To Do
------------


Possible additions:
------------

- Remap Keys
- Original joystick support (eg: Competition Pro / Speedlink Pro USB)



What's next?

------------

Thanks go out to Squarepusher, Shinhalsafar, Cm0nkey, Airmaker for their hard work on the Snes9x PS3 port
and their cellFramework library.

Also to the original VICE team for creating an extremely solid and well maintained codebase to work with.
